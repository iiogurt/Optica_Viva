## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-09

### Added
- Static, offline-capable app shell: sidebar navigation, hash router, lazily loaded laboratories, and an "under construction" notice for laboratories that are not implemented yet.
- Dark design system: Fraunces, Inter and JetBrains Mono typography, responsive lab layout and custom controls.
- Numerical core:
  - Radix-2 complex FFT and 2-D FFT.
  - CIE 1931 colour-matching functions, spectral → sRGB conversion, and inferno/viridis/magma/diverging colormaps.
  - Sellmeier glass catalogue (12 glasses), Abbe number, partial dispersion and group index.
  - Exact 3-D sequential ray tracer with paraxial first-order analysis, real-ray aiming, automatic clear apertures and OPD against the exit-pupil reference sphere.
  - Pupil synthesis (circle, polygon iris, obstructions and spiders, Hubble, JWST, Keck, ELT), Noll Zernike polynomials, monochromatic and polychromatic FFT PSFs, Strehl ratio and Bessel J₁.
  - Canvas charting, KaTeX helpers and the sensor-format table.
- **Introduction** page with a live hero: white light dispersed by an N-SF11 prism, traced with Sellmeier indices.
- **Physical foundations** page: the electromagnetic → scalar → geometric hierarchy, aberration theory, Fourier optics and radiometry.
- **Real-lens ray tracing** laboratory: five prescriptions, meridional trace, magnified caustic, spot diagram, ray-fan plot, chromatic focal shift, best-focus search, and the diffraction PSF from the traced wavefront.
- KaTeX 0.16.11 vendored for offline math rendering.
- README, CHANGELOG, `.gitignore`, `.editorconfig` and `package.json`.
